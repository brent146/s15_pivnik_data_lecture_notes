## Lecture 1

Prof. Anderson is asking us to create a repo on Github and take notes in Markdown. I'm not sure how I feel about this. 

Things pertaining to Big Data:
Social networks, data analytics, sampling, storage,

Statistics are built on sampling. Big Data can make us omnipotent. We can know exactly how many times an event happened
for instance. 

Do the analysis when the data comes in. It will be less painful. Data modeling is wicked hard. You have to change the model to ask a specific question. This is ungodly for big data. 

Info-biz: D3 (javascript), R (more of data analysis)

Data Lifecycle: Axe a Question<-Collection->Cleanup->Storage->Processing Analysis->Query + Visualization
Curation Factors: Persistence(Longevity), Triage(Prioritization)
